This project is a fully developed REST API built using Go and Gorm, focusing on efficient database management. Itâ€™s designed to handle common CRUD operations with scalability and performance in mind. While Gin is not used as the web framework, the API is structured to be integrated into future projects, such as a Flutter application, where it will serve as the backend.

I plan to incorporate this REST API into my Flutter project to enhance the functionality and provide backend support for features like user management, data storage, and real-time updates
